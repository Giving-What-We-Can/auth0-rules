/**
 * Single Page Applications don't have an easy way to inspect which scopes are
 * present on the Access Token. The Access Token should be treated as an opaque
 * string (even though it's technically possible to decode it if it's a JWT).
 * Instead, we should place any data that's supposed to be accessible to the
 * application into the ID Token.
 *
 * We restrict this to the subset of applications that are in fact SPA's, as
 * other applications may use cookies to store Auth0 sessions, and adding a lot
 * of scopes to the ID Token (which will also by necessity be added to the
 * Access Token) will significantly increase cookie size (which may cause failed
 * HTTP requests â€“ total HTTP headers should be smaller than 8kb).
